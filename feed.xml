                <p class="" data-start="129" data-end="363">After 7 years of meticulous planning, I have finally decided to publish a personal blog. You might be wondering, why did it take 7 years? Well, that makes the two of us (or many of us? But I shouldn’t get ahead of myself).</p>
<p class="" data-start="365" data-end="560">These 7 years have been a typical case of analysis paralysis. Worrying about the sea of options rather than just going ahead and doing it. Glad I’m out of it. Excited to publish a space of my own.</p>
<p data-start="365" data-end="560">Thanks for being here :)</p>
