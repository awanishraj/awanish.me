You might be wondering, why did it take 7 years? Well, that makes the two of us (or many of us? But I shouldn’t get ahead of myself).</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"365\" data-end=\"560\">These 7 years have been a typical case of analysis paralysis. Worrying about the sea of options rather than just going ahead and doing it. Glad I’m out of it. Excited to publish a space of my own.</p>\n<p data-start=\"365\" data-end=\"560\">Thanks for being here :)</p>",
