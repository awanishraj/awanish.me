            "content_html": "<p class=\"\" data-start=\"204\" data-end=\"506\">As a long-time programmer, the thought of hosting a personal blog isn’t scary at all. After all, I build a complex wealth management platform for a living. But the journey to get this site up and running has been a short yet solid re-affirmation of some of my philosophies on simplicity and complexity.</p>\n<h2 data-start=\"508\" data-end=\"549\">Simplicity is harder than complexity!</h2>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"551\" data-end=\"846\">As we grow up, we see the world around us become more sophisticated and complex. An over-designed presentation or a bedazzled project report usually earns claps and cheers. So it’s no wonder we equate complexity with progress — and think that’s what everyone should strive for. But is it really?</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"848\" data-end=\"1541\">One of my earliest memories of <em data-start=\"879\" data-end=\"896\">anti-complexity</em> being appreciated was during a presentation attended by Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT Madras. I was lucky to be in the audience. The presenter did her best to deliver a visually striking presentation. But what the professor said at the end shocked almost everyone in the room. He said, “All is well, but in the future, I want your presentation to be black and white, and just simple bullet points.” That was definitely a contrarian opinion to my 20-something-year-old self. But he went on to explain why — the fanciness of the presentation was a distraction, and the presentation should be about the topic, not the makeup. That stuck with me.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1543\" data-end=\"2173\">It’s been a decade of building things (robots, apps, websites, servers, etc.) since then. I’ve been in full control of the decisions behind them — and also responsible when they don’t work well. Over time, that responsibility has helped shape my thinking about how to build things. Tech, especially software, is always iterative. It gives you opportunities to build, maintain, destroy, and rebuild — Trimurti: Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh. And with each iteration, I’ve developed a compass that guides me toward the next best version. What I’m about to say comes from that lived experience: <em data-start=\"2128\" data-end=\"2173\">Simplicity — not complexity — is the motto.</em></p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2175\" data-end=\"2583\">Let me explain this with the second law of thermodynamics: In the universe, entropy (disorder/chaos) is always increasing. But life somehow manages to decrease local entropy and create order. The higher the life form, the more it reduces chaos. In that sense, simplicity is the purest expression of life — creating more order in chaos. So it makes sense that simplicity is harder to achieve. But why is that?</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2585\" data-end=\"2944\"><strong data-start=\"2585\" data-end=\"2654\">Simplicity is hard because the choices you need to make are hard.</strong><br data-start=\"2654\" data-end=\"2657\">If you didn’t have to make hard choices, you wouldn’t be cutting out chaos. Building something complex is easy — it’s equivalent to spraying and praying. But to make complexity simple, you need to hit the bullseye. The only difference is: most of the time, you can’t even see the target.</p>\n<h2 data-start=\"2946\" data-end=\"2999\"><strong data-start=\"2946\" data-end=\"2999\">So what does this have to do with the tech stack?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3001\" data-end=\"3405\">Good question. When I started researching the best way to build and host my site, I was thrown into a myriad of options — Jekyll with GH Pages, Astro with Netlify CMS, Ghost blog with a database, and tons of others. I tried every option because I wanted everything they had to offer. But after juggling npm installs, version conflicts, and deployment subscriptions, I realized I was giving in to entropy.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3407\" data-end=\"3557\">As usual, I went back to my instincts: <em data-start=\"3446\" data-end=\"3481\">What do I really want to achieve?</em><br data-start=\"3481\" data-end=\"3484\">I want to write content and publish it. That’s it. No bells and whistles.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3559\" data-end=\"3607\">That search for simplicity led me to <strong data-start=\"3596\" data-end=\"3606\"><a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii</a></strong>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://awanish.me/media/posts/4/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-2.35.51-PM-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2624\" height=\"1624\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://awanish.me/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-2.35.51-PM-2-xs.png 320w ,https://awanish.me/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-2.35.51-PM-2-sm.png 480w ,https://awanish.me/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-2.35.51-PM-2-md.png 768w ,https://awanish.me/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-2.35.51-PM-2-xl.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3609\" data-end=\"3861\">Publii is a macOS app that connects directly to your GitHub repo.

I’ll talk about each of them separately and then connect the dots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Learning Python</h3>\n<p>Back in 2012, I was home in Port Blair for the summer holidays after my first year in college. My parents had tried their best to get me an internet connection at home, but the best we could get on the island was a 2G dongle. So before packing up from my hostel, I made sure to download a copy of <em>O’Reilly’s Python for Dummies</em> and set up a working installation on my laptop.</p>\n<p>Programming in isolation, without modern-day distractions, was a rewarding experience by itself. I was already pretty good at C and C++ from school, so picking up Python wasn’t daunting. But man, was I in for a fun surprise. Python is frikkin cool. It didn’t even feel like coding. It felt like writing pseudo-code and actually getting away with it.</p>\n<p>One of the most fascinating things I started exploring was image processing. In a Python program, an image isn’t a snapshot of reality or a creative masterpiece. It’s just a 2D matrix of pixels. Each pixel is a combo of Red, Green, and Blue values, each represented by 1 byte, which means a number between 0 and 255. With just these three primary colors—RGB—you can represent any color on screen.</p>\n<p>As a kid, I was pretty good at watercolor art, so this all made intuitive sense to me.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://awanish.me/media/posts/3/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-9-2025-11_51_48-PM-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://awanish.me/media/posts/3/responsive/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-9-2025-11_51_48-PM-2-xs.png 320w ,https://awanish.me/media/posts/3/responsive/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-9-2025-11_51_48-PM-2-sm.png 480w ,https://awanish.me/media/posts/3/responsive/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-9-2025-11_51_48-PM-2-md.png 768w ,https://awanish.me/media/posts/3/responsive/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-9-2025-11_51_48-PM-2-xl.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>Then came the epiphany: if every image is nothing but a 2D matrix of RGB values, then theoretically, if you could generate enough permutations and combinations of those values, you could generate <em>every</em> image. Every image that has ever existed, every image that ever will, or even ones that never will.</p>\n<p>Every person, living or dead.<br>Every person not yet born.<br>Every object, every car, every schematic, every logo, every planet, every being in the universe.<br>Maybe even the answer to life.</p>\n<p>It’s all just one random combination of pixels.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>The Library of Babel</h3>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2552\" data-end=\"2650\">Then a couple of years later, I was watching a video by VSauce – <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GDrBIKOR01c?si=0j5KS5WalCACgKag&amp;t=1026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em data-start=\"2617\" data-end=\"2642\">Messages For The Future</em> (17:07)</a></p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2652\" data-end=\"2859\">As with any VSauce video, it was a power pack of information from all over the place that to this day has no match. In the later half of the video, Michael talks about the Library of Babel, and to quote him:</p>\n<blockquote data-start=\"2861\" data-end=\"3195\">\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2863\" data-end=\"3195\">...the Library of Babel. It’s a website built by Jonathan Basile that currently offers everything that has been or could be written… Basile has organized it all into hexagon-shaped rooms, each with four walls of books containing five shelves with 32 volumes of 410 pages each… browsing the online library feels like a treasure hunt…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote data-start=\"3197\" data-end=\"3521\">\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3199\" data-end=\"3521\">Every possible combination of English letters, spaces, commas, and periods—3,200 characters long—exists somewhere in this library. You can find in this library the description of your birth, every possible description of your death, every poem, every joke, every lie, anything that could be said can be found on this site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote data-start=\"3523\" data-end=\"3664\">\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3525\" data-end=\"3664\">This thing blurs the line between invention and discovery.

Are we inventing or discovering? In every sense, you could think of both invention and discovery as two sides of the same coin. If one is top down, then the other is bottom up. You need to discover to invent and you need to invent to discover. Whether the Library of Babel or my Gallery of Babel, they contain everything already. So the next time you click a photo, just remember that it was already there in my gallery.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"4424\" data-end=\"4769\">But before you lose hope, I want to tell you that you are not random, you are special, and so is your photo. When you click the photo, it was a needle in my haystack. I could have not found the needle in millions or billions of years, but you did, so you win. But jokes aside, I believe this is a statement about the conscious experience itself.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>AI Images</h3>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"5054\" data-end=\"5253\">As I promised, it is time to tie it all together. AI-generated images work on a technology called a <strong data-start=\"5154\" data-end=\"5173\">diffusion model</strong>.

Also, is AI an invention or a discovery?</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"5564\" data-end=\"5864\">That’s a thinker.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5564\" data-end=\"5864\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

You might be wondering, why did it take 7 years? Well, that makes the two of us (or many of us? But I shouldn’t get ahead of myself).</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"365\" data-end=\"560\">These 7 years have been a typical case of analysis paralysis. Worrying about the sea of options rather than just going ahead and doing it. Glad I’m out of it. Excited to publish a space of my own.</p>\n<p data-start=\"365\" data-end=\"560\">Thanks for being here :)</p>",
